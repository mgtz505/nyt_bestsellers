# NYT Best-Sellers (An App built w/ React)


## What is this application?
When I find myself wanting to read a new book, I tend to spend more time than I should trying to find which book I want to begin reading. Sometimes it can feel like a huge commitment! I created this application to help users (hopefully) find their next read more quickly than they otherwise would. This app uses the NYT Developer API to render a display of the latest iteration of the NYT's bestseller list for four categories. Once a category has been selected, users can select among 15 rendered book-covers that will populate the display. Once a title has been selected, details about that selection appear below, including links to online-retailers where that title can be purchased.

## Which technologies were used in creating this application?
This app was created using React hooks. I uploaded and deployed the application via Heroku. At the bottom of this repo, I've listed the online resources I used during this project.


## How can I use this application?

If you simply want to see this application in action, follow this link: https://nyt-best-sellers.herokuapp.com/

Otherwise, feel free to fork & clone this repo. Once you connect to a development server, feel free to play with the code as you see fit. Should you want to contribute to the development of this project, I think that improving the UX is probably the highest priority. There are some small visual blemishes that I would like to address once I have a chance to revisit this project.
