# NYT Best Seller Bookshelf

Description: Describe at a high level what your project is and the motivation for the project (i.e., what problem(s) your projects solves) and includes a screenshot of the application in the browser.
## What is this application?
When I find myself wanting to read a new book, I tend to spend more time than I should trying to find which book I want to begin. Sometimes it can feel like a huge commitment! I created this application to help users (hopefully) find their next read more quickly than they otherwise would. This app uses the NYT Developer API to render a display of the latest iteration of the NYT's bestseller list for four categories. Once a category has been selected, users can select among 15 rendered book-covers that will populate the display. Once a title has been selected, details about that selection appear below, including links to online-retailers where that title can be purchased.

Otherwise, feel free to fork & clone this repo. Once you connect to a development server, feel free to play with the code as you see fit. Should you want to contribute to the development of this project, I think that improving the UX is probably the highest priority. There are some small visual blemishes that I would like to address once I have a chance to revisit this project.
